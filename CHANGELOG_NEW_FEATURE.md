# Changelog - Preprompt Selection Feature

## New Feature Added

The Ulauncher Perplexity extension now includes a preprompt selection feature.

### How It Works

1. **User types the keyword** (e.g., `px`) followed by a space
2. **Extension shows a list** of all available preprompts from the `prepromts/` folder
3. **User selects a preprompt** (e.g., "doc" or "explain")
4. **Input field is automatically updated** to `px <preprompt-name> ` (e.g., `px doc `)
5. **User can then type their query** after the preprompt name

### What Changed

**File Modified:** `main.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added import for `SetUserQueryAction` to enable modifying the user's input field
- Modified the `on_event` method to detect when only the keyword is entered (empty query)
- When query is empty, the extension now:
  - Lists all files in the preprompts directory
  - Displays them as selectable items
  - Uses `SetUserQueryAction` to populate the input field when selected
- Reorganized code to load preprompts directory path earlier to avoid duplication

### Backward Compatibility

âœ… All existing functionality remains intact:
- Direct usage still works: `px doc my query` works as before
- Preprompt files work exactly the same way
- Search without preprompts still works
- All preferences and settings unchanged

### Testing

The feature has been tested to ensure:
- Python syntax is valid
- Preprompt files are correctly listed
- No existing functionality was broken
