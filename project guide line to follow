this preprompts extention allows user to enter prompt to perplexity without openig browser

i want modified this extention like this
new features

1.use need to able use premade prompts + new promts 
 how it works:
that inside project folder need to add new folder name prepromts/ and add custom prompts custom promts are can call through ulauncher input fild like using triger word

work flow example

user enter this propmt in ulauncher inputfild like this "px doc react useStates" 
px : mean extention call keyword for uluncher
doc : mean premade prompt that inside of prepormts/ floder
react useStates : means user enterd new prompt that must combine with premade promt

premade prompt + custom prmot combine example look like
(you need only use refernce of devdoc and offical programing language defualt doc and give me explanation using only those and here my concept to i need learn : react useStates)

when user enter the "px doc react useStates" it directed to perplexity and auto enter the combine prompt to perplexity.
